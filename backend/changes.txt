change title to category everywhere
why updateTask ? in techcontroller
keep success: true/false everywhere in res.send/json
upload image by tech in resolveTask

    why this ? 'const technician = await Technician.findById(assignedTechId);' when u already did req.technician=technician

placed reportId in reportmodel (E001, E002, W001, W002..) -> wil check again
whts with your tp.js? check and remove it

make login for department->nmae, password

upload image after technician resolves

delte this file at last
